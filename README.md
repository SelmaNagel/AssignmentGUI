# Assignment 1: Java Swing GUI & OOP Basics

This is an educational project completed as part of a software development course. The main goal was to practice fundamental concepts of creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with the Java Swing library and to apply core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## üöÄ Key Features & Skills Demonstrated

This project is divided into three parts, each focusing on different skills:

### Part 1: Static GUI Layout
* Creating a basic application window (`JFrame`).
* Using panels (`JPanel`) and buttons (`JButton`).
* Applying absolute positioning to arrange components manually (`setLayout(null)`).

### Part 2: Interactive GUI with Event Handling
* Adding interactive components like `JCheckBox`.
* Implementing event listeners (`ActionListener`) to respond to user actions.
* Dynamically changing the appearance of components (e.g., button colors) based on events.

### Part 3: Core OOP Principles
* Creating a custom Java class (`House`) with private instance variables.
* Implementing overloaded constructors.
* Writing getter and setter methods to encapsulate data.
* Creating and manipulating objects from a class.
